Zonder where:

    ORDER BY `c` DESC

  GROUP BY `expedition_climbers`.`climber_id`
  ORDER BY COUNT(`expedition_climbers`.`expedition_id`) DESC
  LIMIT (SELECT MAX(`c`) FROM `max_subquery`);

Met where:
WITH `max_subquery` AS (
  SELECT COUNT(`expedition_id`) as `c`
    FROM `expedition_climbers`
    GROUP BY `climber_id`
    ORDER BY `c` DESC
)
SELECT `climbers`.*
  FROM `climbers`
    LEFT JOIN `expedition_climbers`
    ON `expedition_climbers`.`climber_id` = `climbers`.`id`
    LEFT JOIN `expeditions`
    ON `expedition_climbers`.`expedition_id` = `expeditions`.`id`
  GROUP BY `expedition_climbers`.`climber_id`
  ORDER BY COUNT(`expedition_climbers`.`expedition_id`) DESC
  LIMIT (SELECT MAX(`c`) FROM `max_subquery`);

Om duplicates te verwijderen
DELETE FROM `mountains`
WHERE `id` NOT IN (
	SELECT MIN(`id`)
	FROM `mountains`
	GROUP BY `name`
);


Deze moet nu goed zijn:
SELECT `climbers`.*
  FROM `expedition_climbers`
    LEFT JOIN `climbers`
	ON `expedition_climbers`.`climber_id` = `climbers`.`id`
  GROUP BY `expedition_climbers`.`climber_id`
  HAVING COUNT(`expedition_climbers`.`climber_id`) = (
    SELECT MAX(`t1`.`count`)
	FROM (
      SELECT COUNT(`expedition_id`) as `count`
	  FROM `expedition_climbers`
	  LEFT JOIN `expeditions`
	  ON `expedition_climbers`.`expedition_id` = `expeditions`.`id`
	  WHERE `expeditions`.`success` = 1
	  GROUP BY `climber_id`
	) `t1`
  );

Nu hetzelfde maar dan mountains:
SELECT `mountains`.*
  FROM `mountains`
    LEFT JOIN `expeditions`
    ON `expeditions`.`mountain_id` = `mountains`.`id`
  GROUP BY `expeditions`.`mountain_id`
  HAVING COUNT(`expeditions`.`mountain_id`) = (
    SELECT MAX(`t1`.`count`)
    FROM (
      SELECT COUNT(`mountain_id`) as `count`
      FROM `expeditions`
      GROUP BY `mountain_id`
    ) `t1`
  );
  

SELECT `climbers`.*
  FROM `expedition_climbers`
    LEFT JOIN `climbers`
	ON `expedition_climbers`.`climber_id` = `climbers`.`id`
	LEFT JOIN `expeditions`
	ON `expeditions`.`id` = `expedition_climbers`.`expedition_id`
  WHERE `expeditions`.`success` = 1
  GROUP BY `expedition_climbers`.`climber_id`
  HAVING COUNT(`expedition_climbers`.`climber_id`) = (
    SELECT MAX(`t1`.`count`)
	FROM (
      SELECT COUNT(`expedition_id`) as `count`, `climber_id`
	  FROM `expedition_climbers`
	  LEFT JOIN `expeditions`
	  ON `expedition_climbers`.`expedition_id` = `expeditions`.`id`
	  WHERE `expeditions`.`success` = 1
	  GROUP BY `climber_id`
	) `t1`
  );
