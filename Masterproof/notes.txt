Met where:

Om duplicates te verwijderen
DELETE FROM `mountains`
WHERE `id` NOT IN (
	SELECT MIN(`id`)
	FROM `mountains`
	GROUP BY `name`
);


Deze moet nu goed zijn:
SELECT `climbers`.*
  FROM `expedition_climbers`
    LEFT JOIN `climbers`
	ON `expedition_climbers`.`climber_id` = `climbers`.`id`
	LEFT JOIN `expeditions`
	ON `expedition_climbers`.`expedition_id` = `expeditions`.`id`
  GROUP BY `expedition_climbers`.`climber_id`
  HAVING COUNT(`expedition_climbers`.`climber_id`) = (
    SELECT MAX(`t1`.`count`)
	FROM (
      SELECT COUNT(`expedition_id`) as `count`
	  FROM `expedition_climbers`
	  GROUP BY `climber_id`
	) `t1`
  );
